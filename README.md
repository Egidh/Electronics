# About this repository :

Welcome here !

Most of my projects use the esp32 micro-controller coupled with the ESP-IDF framework. I have also included (not so) detailed documentation and schematics for each project to help you understand the design and implementation.

## Introduction

This repository contains various electronics projects that I have worked on. Each project includes source code, schematics, and documentation to help you replicate and understand the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow the instructions provided in the respective project folders. Make sure you have the necessary hardware components and software tools installed.
